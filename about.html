    </div>
    <p class="p-2">Introducing Power EV, a software designed to cater to all your electric vehicle charging requirements.</p>
    <p class="p-1">Problem Statement</p>
    <p class="p-2">There is a growing number of electric vehicle (EV) owners who need access to charging stations to keep their vehicles charged.However, the availability of charging stations and the lack of real-time information on their occupancy can lead to long waiting times and inefficient use of resources.This creates a need for an app that can allow EV owners to easily locate and reserve available charging slots, reducing wait times and improving the overall charging experience. By solving these issues, the app can make the charging process more convenient and efficient, encouraging more people to switch to electric vehicles and reducing the overall environmental impact of transportation. </p>
    <p class="p-1">Our Solution</p>
    <p class="p-2">The application is designed to furnish users with pertinent details regarding charging station locations, availability of connectors, and associated pricing. Additionally, users can utilize the app to make payments for their charging sessions, and we also offer navigation assistance to guide them to the designated charging station.</p>
